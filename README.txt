To run the application it's enough just to call "mvnw spring-boot:run" from root directory.

Default DB url is 'D:/db/loopme', you can set custom value in application.properties#spring.datasource.url
While starting the application first time, the default 'Admin'-user will be created to check the features. So, to log in you should use the following credentials:
username: sa
password: sa
